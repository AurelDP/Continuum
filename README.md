## Prerequisites

- **Java 17** or higher
- **Maven 3.6.0** or higher
- **Docker**
- **Jenkins 2.444** or higher
- **Minikube**
- **Helm**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that you can execute `sh` commands in your terminal as Jenkinsfile uses shell commands. \
> To enable it with git on **Windows**, please **replace the path** `C:\Program Files\Git\bin` with `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin` (or equivalent if git is installed to another location)
> in the system environment variable `Path` and **restart your terminal** (or the node's terminal for **Jenkins**).

## Deployment with Jenkins

The deployment is managed by **Jenkins** via a pipeline defined in the Jenkinsfile. The deployment is done on a **Kubernetes cluster**. \
To configure **Jenkins**, you can choose the **automatic configuration** with a **Docker volume** or the **manual configuration**.

### Automatic Jenkins configuration

A Docker volume is used to store Jenkins data. \
A volume has already been created, with all the necessary configuration for the pipeline to work properly.

To retrieve the Docker volume:
- Install the `Volumes Backup & Share` extension in **Docker Desktop**
- From the extension, import the volume from the **Docker Hub registry** `docker.io/aureldp/continuum_jenkins_volume:latest` and name it `continuum_jenkins_volume`

To start Jenkins with the Docker volume, run the Jenkins image with the following command:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --name continuum_jenkins --mount source=continuum_jenkins_volume,target=/var/jenkins_home docker.io/jenkins/jenkins:2.444
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to use a version of **Jenkins** equal to or greater than **2.444**.

The connection information for Jenkins can be found in the report associated with the project.

> [!NOTE]
> The workspace path of the `slave` node associated with the pipeline will need to be modified in the **Jenkins node configuration**.

### Manual Jenkins configuration

In the case where the Docker volume associated with the project is not available or not working, it is possible to **manually configure Jenkins** to run the pipeline. \
Make sure Jenkins is **already configured** on your machine.

#### General configuration

1. Create a Jenkins node with Docker and Maven installed (**label this node** `slave`)
    - If the workspace of the node is on your local machine, **Docker** and **Maven** must be installed on it
2. Make sure that the **Kubernetes**, **Kubernetes CLI**, **Docker**, **Docker Pipeline**, **Git** and **Prometheus** plugins are installed
3. Configure a **Docker credential** (username and password) `dockerhub_id` to connect to Docker Hub

#### Pipeline configuration

1. Create a new pipeline `ContinuumDeploymentPipeline` in Jenkins
2. Configure the pipeline with the content of the [Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/AurelDP/Continuum/blob/main/ops/Jenkinsfile)
3. Start the Jenkins node `slave` to run the pipeline

### Pipeline launch

After configuring Jenkins, it is possible to launch the `ContinuumDeploymentPipeline` pipeline to deploy the application on a **Kubernetes cluster**.

1. **Start minikube** with the command `minikube start`
2. Run the `ContinuumDeploymentPipeline` pipeline in Jenkins
3. Check that the deployment was successful with the command:
    ```bash
    kubectl get all -n production
    ```
4. Check that the **application is accessible** at http://localhost:8082 (port in production mode)
   - **Port forwarding** can be done with the command:
        ```bash
        kubectl port-forward svc/continuum-service 8082:8082 -n production
        ```
   - It is also possible to use the command `minikube tunnel` to expose the service outside the Kubernetes cluster without having to forward the port

## Monitor the application with Prometheus and Grafana

To monitor the application, **Prometheus** and **Grafana** are used.

### Installing Prometheus and Grafana

**Prometheus** and **Grafana** are installed with **Helm**. \
Run the script [install_monitoring.sh](https://github.com/AurelDP/Continuum/blob/main/ops/install_monitoring.sh) to install **Prometheus** and **Grafana** on the Kubernetes cluster.
```bash
sh ops/install_monitoring.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Helm** must be installed on your machine to run the script and **Minikube** must be started.

### Accessing Prometheus and Grafana

Run the script [launch_monitoring.sh](https://github.com/AurelDP/Continuum/blob/main/ops/launch_monitoring.sh) to access **Prometheus** and **Grafana**:
```bash
sh ops/launch_monitoring.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> Port forwarding is done automatically with the script, please do not close the terminal while using the monitoring tools.

### Configuration of Grafana

1. Access **Grafana** at http://localhost:3000
2. Log in with the following credentials:
    - **Username**: admin
    - **Password**: password given by the launching script
3. Add a **datasource** with the following information:
   - **Name**: prometheus
   - **Type**: Prometheus
   - **Connection URL**: http://host.docker.internal:9090
4. Import the **dashboard** from the file [grafana-dashboard.json](https://github.com/AurelDP/Continuum/blob/main/ops/grafana-dashboard.json) to visualize the metrics of the application

## Additional information

- The application is accessible at port **8081** in development mode and at port **8082** in production mode
- The connection information for **Docker Hub** can be found in the report associated with the project
